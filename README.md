# aleBot

## aleBot is another multipurpose bot, but it's modular!

### Support

If you need assistance setting up the bot, or adding to it, come join [the support server!](https://discord.gg/3QpFUQx)

If you make a pull request, please submit it to Review and not master.

### Setup

1. Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
2. Open Git Bash in a folder somewhere, and run `git clone https://github.com/AleanaA/aleBot.git`
3. Ensure you have Python and pip installed, and added to your path. The bot was built using [Python 3.5.4,](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.4/python-3.5.4-amd64.exe) so that's your best bet.
4. In the root directory of the bot, run `python -m pip -U -r requirements.txt` on windows, or `python3 -m pip -U -r requirements.txt` on Ubuntu.
5. Create a bot account over on the [Discord developers page.](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
6. Setup the config file in the `config` folder. This includes copying `config.example.py` and `config.exemple.ini` to `config.py` and `config.ini` and adding your bot token, your user id, your prefix, an announcement, log, and auddit log channel, and five roles.
7. That's it! Run the bot with either `run.bat` or `run.sh` and you should be good to go!

It should be noted that emotes will probably be displayed incorrectly, as you won't have the emotes in `emotes.py`\n
To fix this, just replace those emote IDs with ones from a server the bot is in, corresponding to the emote.

### Commands

All commands can be listed using the help command, but role required commands are:

- eval - Owner
- die - Owner
- avatar - Owner
- username - Owner
- load - Owner
- unload - Owner
- reload - Owner
- ban - Mod
- banid - Mod
- softban - Mod
- unban - Mod
- kick - Apprentice
- log - Apprentice
- say - Event
- announce - Event

There is an invite command, so if you don't want users to be able to access your bot without permission,\n
be sure to uncheck public bot on the [page where you created your bot!](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

### Roles

The role permissions work as follows:

- Owner has permission to all commands, except Event
- Admin has permission to Admin commands and lower, except Event
- Supervisor has permission to Supervisor commands and lower, except Event
- Moderator has permission to Moderator commands and lower, except Event
- Apprentice has permission to Apprentice commands, and no others.
- Event has permissions to Event commands. All event commands require the user to have the Event role no matter what.

As an example, if you want to have three roles instead of five, you can put the same role in for Admin and Supervisor, and the Same in for Moderator and Apprentice, or if you'd like all of the roles to have access to Event commands, make the Event role the same as the Apprentice role.
